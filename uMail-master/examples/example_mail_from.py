# Setting the MAIL FROM address
#
# Some services may require you to set the MAIL FROM address different than your 
# login username. In such cases, you can manually specify the address by
# smtp.to(mail_from=address)
# If argument not set, MAIL FROM address will be default to your login username.
#
